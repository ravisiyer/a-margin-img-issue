          Horizontal scrollbar appears only at very low window width (less than
          200px) and so not an issue

        <br /><span>
          Horizontal scrollbar appears only at very low window width (less than
          200px) and so not an issue
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I also tried out
      <a href="imw100vw-BB-small6.html">100vw for img max-width</a>. As
      expected, it did not solve the issue of horizontal scrollbar appearing at
      less than around 700px.

    <p>
      Removing the style statement from the anchor element in which the image is
      contained, also fixes the problem even if img max-width is 100%. But that
      involves editing the HTML file and so is not feasible as a solution for
      BFTB app. However, just for capturing that test, I have included
      <a href="imw100pc-BB-small7.html">the page</a>.
