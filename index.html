          Horizontal scrollbar appears only at very low window width (less than
          200px) and so not an issue
        </span>
      </li>

        >
        <br /><span
          >Horizontal scrollbar appears at medium window width (less than 700px)
          and so an issue</span

        <a href="imw100pc-BB-smallFixed.html"
          >CSS main-book img selector has declaration: 'max-width: 100%;' and
          main-book a selector sets margin to 0</a
        >
        <br /><span>
          Horizontal scrollbar appears only at very low window width (less than
          200px) and so not an issue
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Removing the style statement from the anchor element in which the image is
      contained also fixes the problem even if img max-width is 100% but that
      involves editing the HTML file and so is not feasible as a solution for
      BFTB app. However, just for capturing that test, I have included
      <a href="imw100pc-BB-small7.html">the page</a>.
